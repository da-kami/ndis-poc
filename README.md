## NDIS Filter example

Pre-requisits: NT-Kernel (wiresock) NDIS Filter implementation has to be installed: https://github.com/wiresock/ndisapi/releases/tag/v3.4.8

The example is based on the filter example from the wiresock Rust repo: https://github.com/wiresock/ndisapi-rs/blob/main/examples/filter.rs

We extend the example to modify packages rather than just reading them.
